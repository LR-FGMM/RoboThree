# RoboThree

A lightweight simulation environment for robots

## Introduction

_RoboThree_ aims to be a very simple 3D simulation environment for robots.

## Architecture

Basically, there is a world where robots can move. The world is represented
and managed by a Three.js web application, with an underlying Physi.js 
physics simulation engine.

At each frame, the world makes an HTTP post request to the simulated robot,
which is implemented as a Node.js command line application.

In this request, the world sends a JSON-formatted array of data (for instance,
the values of the sensors) and the robot sends a JSON-formatted array of
other data (basically, the values of the actuators).
