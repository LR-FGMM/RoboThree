# RoboThree

A lightweight simulation environment for robots

## Introduction

_RoboThree_ aims to be a very simple 3D simulation environment for robots.

It is JavaScript-based. The client side (the simulation environment) is implemented using *jQuery*, *Three.js* and other useful libraries (see Credits, below).
The server side (robots' behaviors) is implemented using *node.js* and emulating an [Espruino board](http://www.espruino.com/). Nothing prevents from implementing the server side in other programming languages, as long as they can read and write data in JSON format and manage a very simple HTTP server.

Simulated robots can have virtual devices (like onboard cameras, a compass, etc.) and can be programmed at low or high level.

## Alternatives

RoboThree aims to be lightweight and very simple in its implementation. If you are interested in something
more realistic (and more complex) you could try:
